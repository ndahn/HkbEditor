# So you want to Behavior?
An excellent choice, good madam/sir! I highly appreciate your distinguished taste. And dare I say, you’re looking marvelous today. Did you apply *<insert appropriate cosmetic stuff>* recently? Excuse me, your charm made me digress. Behaviors. Right…

# Why should you care about behaviors?
Behaviors are the glue between player inputs and animations and have been used in most recent Fromsoft titles: *Dark Souls 3, Sekiro, Elden Ring, Nightreign* (Armored Core 6 uses a different system). They control which animation to play, how to transition into other animations, allow to layer animations on top of each other, and more. It’s a fairly complex system that you will most likely get exposed to if you are getting into movesets (although there are also some weapons and other things that have behaviors). Even then you will probably only touch the surface, especially if you stay within the realms of what the game already does (e.g. up to 6 light attacks, 2 heavy attacks, etc.). 

However, once you leave these familiar waters things start to look different. Different stance poses depending on the weapon type? Behavior. Custom idles without creating an entire idle category? Behavior. New throw attacks and reactions? Behavior...

???+ tip "Behaviors are awesome!"

Of course, even if you don’t plan to do anything like this, it’s nice to have a little more insight into how the game works. If this sounds even mildly interesting to you, read on!
