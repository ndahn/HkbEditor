# In case you screwed up
It's possible to screw up your behavior in more or less subtle ways that can lead to game crashes (if you can convert it back at all). Whether it was a bug or your own doing, the first thing you should do is run the *Workflows -> Verify Behavior* function. Carefully check the terminal output for any problems and try to fix them, then save again and retry.

## Shooting troubles
If something just doesn't work, always check the terminal for errors first. If you think something went wrong that should have worked, either open a Github issue or contact *@Managarm* on [*?ServerName?*](https://discord.gg/J5msG6Es). Make sure to include as many details as possible - at the very least what you did and what the error was.
