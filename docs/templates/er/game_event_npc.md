Creates multipe NPC game events that can be triggered from HKS, EMEVD, ESD, objects, etc. This is always a full animation, half blends are not possible. Event animations are often used for boss phase transitions. Once registered it can be used like any other animation.

???+ note 

    The event IDs will also correspond to the animation IDs.

???+ warning

    Don't forget to run `File -> Update name ID files` to add new entries to `action/eventnameid.txt`!
