This template allows you to register in the 3000~3109 range for any enemy. New events can be called by AI and events. Note that this should be used on a c9997.xml behavior.

For every animation generated, two corresponding events are generated: `W_AttackYYY` and `W_EventYYY`, where `YYY` is the Y part of the animation ID (`aXXX_YYYYYY` without leading zeros).
