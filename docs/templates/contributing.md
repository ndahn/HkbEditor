# Contributing Templates

The best (that is, for me easiest) way to include a new template is by writing it, testing it and then sending it to me :yum:

That being said, getting into behaviors is already a little daunting. If you have an idea/need for a new template I will be happy to write it for you *iff* you can tell me:

- what the template is for
- how the behavior works (i.e. how does FromSoft do it?)
- how to use the new behavior (e.g. from HKS)

Ideally you can also highlight any important details like looped clips or non-standard transition effects, but I will check for these myself as I work on it. At the very least I need to know where to start looking and how it works, so please do your research. Testing will always be up to you :innocent:

???+ note

    Things that are not useful:

    - XML sections (I just find it easier to look stuff up in HkbEditor)
    - Object IDs (will be different when the behavior was edited)
